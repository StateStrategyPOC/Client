# Client
Client application for the D_MVC POC. Master thesis work in computer science and engineering. 

Note that, by default, this client is set to dialogate with a server on port 29999 on localhost. You can change the port and the host by acting on ```client_store/ClientState.java```. No tests have been conducted with a different host/port configuration.
